                                Built and maintained multiple membership projects by gathering requirements, designing architecture, and breaking down user stories. Collaborated with cross-functional teams, resulting in a 90% increase in user retention for membership verticals and an increase of $3.5M in LTV/year for program support expansion across all countries.                            
                            </li>

                                Led the team to execute accessibility changes and worked closely with QA to prioritize tasks, resulting in increased team awareness and understanding of web accessibility guidelines. Successfully performed changes that led to an ADA-compliant membership flow.

                            <li>
                                Improved stability by implementing unit and regression tests using Jest, Mocha and TestCafe. Additionally, I created monitoring charts using Splunk and Amplitude to proactively identify and address production issues.

                            <li>
                                Demonstrated proficiency in designing and developing complex and reusable user interfaces that align with design specifications created in Figma.

                            <li>
                                Migrated legacy front-end code (BackboneJs) to a modern stack built on ReactJS and TypeScript. This was accomplished through strict testing protocols and the implementation of a CI/CD pipeline. As a result of this migration, we experienced a 120% improvement in software delivery time.
